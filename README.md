TANDEMLOOP — Screening Test Solutions (Full Stack Developer)

This repository contains my solutions to the Screening Test (Stage 1) for the Full Stack Developer position at Tandemloop.

All four problems are solved using Python, and each problem is placed in a separate file as instructed.

Files in this Repository
File	Description
Program-1.py	Calculator implemented using a class (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division).
Program-2.py	Generates the first a odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ...).
Program-3.py	Generates an odd-number pattern where even inputs use the previous odd count.
Program-4.py	Counts how many numbers in the list are multiples of each number from 1 to 9.
How to Run

Install Python 3.x (if not already installed).

Open a terminal or command prompt in this project folder.

Run any program using:

python Program-1.py
python Program-2.py
python Program-3.py
python Program-4.py

Each program will take input if required and print the output.

Problem Summary (Combined)
Problem 1: Calculator using Class

Takes input values a, b, and an operation type (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and prints the result.

Problem 2: Odd Number Series

Given an integer a, prints the first a odd numbers.

Problem 3: Conditional Odd Number Series

Given an integer a:

If a is odd, print odd numbers up to that count.

If a is even, print odd numbers up to the previous odd count.

Problem 4: Count Multiples

Given the list:

[1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 46, 76, 82, 15, 20, 30]


Counts how many numbers are multiples of each number from 1 to 9 and prints the result as a dictionary.
